As an outdoors-type of person I need to reliably know if the weather conditions are safe for me to go outside or not. In
an effort to keep track of the daily changes to weather patterns, I created a weather application that will help me know
if I can spend time outside or not. I learned how to fetch information from APIs and convert them into readable data using javascript.
